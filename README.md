# Dispatcher System

Main idea of this project is to develop a dispatcher system that will evaluate processes obtained from 
the input and out them in correct algorithms to maintain stability in a CPU working environment. 
Project is coded in C language. Main functions of this dispatcher system are FCFS, SJF and RR 
algorithms.

## Usage

To create cpu_schedular.exe simply run make

```bash
  make
```
And it will output the exe file to /bin directory.
